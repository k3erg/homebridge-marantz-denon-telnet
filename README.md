# homebridge-marantz-denon-telnet
Denon and Marantz AVR Telnet Plugin for Homebridge.



## What does this package do?
This package was inspired by [homebridge-denon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-denon). But the newer marantz and Denon AVR's with HEOS dropped the web-based-controls. So I resorted back to the good ol' telnet. This allows rather precise control over a very wide aspect of the AVR.

The package is still in a very early stage - feedback is welcome. It supports multiple zones and is zeroconf, i.e. the AVR's (should) be found by upnp.



## How to Install this package?
(sudo) npm install -g homebridge-marantz-denon-telnet



## How to use this package?
This plugin is zeroconf.



## Tested on?

 * marantz SR7011



enjoy!
